# Inflexion2 

Inflexion is an spanish word that means inflection, but both words has the same pronunciation and the same meanig in both languages. The number "2" is not a version is only the [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) of 'to' to help to indicate where to change the direction, of your goals.

This framework is under construction, forever ... and is trying to folow the best practices of Domain Driven Design. The objective of this framework is to help to write applications, complex applications or simple applications. Dividing the complex applications in different modules or groupping many simple applications under only one umbrella. In this way wouldbe easy in any big coorporation convert many simple isolated applications in modules of one unique system.

This framework is designed to chose wich technologies to use for one application, becouse the only important thing is to keep simple the bussines logic of any system.

Also this framework, is constructed in a very systematic point of view, becouse in the future, would be useful to use code generation to get the applications, perhaps not whole applications but can help to do the most tedious parts.
